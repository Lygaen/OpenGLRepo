# OpenGL Setup
A setup for [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) with [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), [GLAD2 loader](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad/tree/glad2) (not the v1 ;)) and [GLM](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html).

## Setup
None ! Everything is self-contained in this repo, statitically linked with CMake !
Just run :
```
$ cmake .
$ make
```
And voil√† ! You've got yourself a handy OpenGL/GLFW/GLM setup out of the box.
